You may have come across Adam's blog `X crash during Fedora update when system 
has hybrid graphics and systemd-udev is in update`_ or the discussion on Fedora 
list `PSA: Do not run 'dnf update' inside GNOME, KDE or any other graphical 
desktop on Fedora 24`_. As always, such discussions, do release a plethora of 
good ideas and tips. Somewhere down the Fedora list thread these ``dnf`` 
plugins were mentioned:

* ``python3-dnf-plugins-extras-tracer`` hosted on Github at 
  `dnf-plugin-extras`_ 

* ``needs-restarting`` part of `dnf-plugins-core`_
