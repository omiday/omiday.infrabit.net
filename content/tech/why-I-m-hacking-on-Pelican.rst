Pelican_ is the software I use to publish this blog. But Pelican_ is more than 
that if you are just starting in Python or contributing to an open source 
project. So what makes Pelican_ a good learning tool? Let's see:


Design
======

If you thought that a blogging software, especially one that spits out a bunch 
of static HTML files can't have a solid architecture you've never met Pelican_.  
This becomes all clear when reading about `Pelican's design`_.


New contributors
================

Programming and computer work in general is more of a solitary activity. You 
talk to yourself, to the keyboard, to the program. Learning good practices from 
the get go is important and there is a ton of stuff a new Pythonista can learn 
from perusing the `Contributing code`_ section. Learn about tips for Python 2 
to 3 compatibility, Github best practices or `sane Git workflows`_, testing 
your code and writing unittests, setting up a development environment and so 
on.


Code comments
=============

Love having clear comments when reading code born in somebody else's brain.  
This just complements the well written documentation.


Conclusion
==========

It's always fun to open up the hood and get to know the internals of the 
machinery you are using frequently. Especially when you are embarking on the 
development path.
