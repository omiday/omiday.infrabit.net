Vimperator_ that I have been a long time user `isn't ready for e10s`_ and the 
work for porting it to `WebExtensions API`_ is going to `take a while`_. Great 
effort from Vimperator_ developers over all these years to provide a feature 
that as a Vim_ user I have greatly appreciated. I wish I could have helped the 
project move forward but these days one can only master so many IT skills and 
Javascript isn't one of mine. With Firefox updates being rolled into Fedora_ it 
was imperative that I look for an alternative.

Introducing VimFx_, a much lighter add-on that "will be nice to your browser 
and your habits." [1]_. I like that. The not so good news is that VimFx_ as we 
know it will only work `for the rest of 2017`_. It's a very active project with 
a good vibe which gives me hopes that the project will survive the 
`WebExtensions API`_ changes.
