I've been using Seamonkey_ as the *very secure* browser to do my online 
banking, login to my government accounts, in short for all those sites where 
security is paramount. Perhaps just another `Firefox profile`_ would do but I 
chose Seamonkey_ because I wanted to get process and profile separation from my 
usual browsing environment. I wanted a browser without any add-ons so things 
"just work" on those clunky bank websites.

Enter iMacros_. Well, more like enter through the backdoor as I've been 
introduced to it by Daniel Dawson's `Save Password Editor`_. Daniel has a very 
useful `FAQ page`_ that is worth reading as is. That's where I came across 
iMacros_ and I quote him::

    For the case of a form created dynamically (as opposed to being written 
    directly in HTML) or employing certain other fancy tricks, the password 
    manager cannot be persuaded to recognize it or cannot fill it properly. In 
    that case, the only solution is to use something else. I usually recommend 
    iMacros for Firefox. Although it's much more powerful than is needed for 
    the task, it's one of the few things that work in almost all cases. You 
    should probably enable its master password feature so that the passwords in 
    your macros will be encrypted. 

Very useful. Thanks go to ipswitch_ who developed iMacros_ and `Daniel Dawson`_ 
for mentioning it.
